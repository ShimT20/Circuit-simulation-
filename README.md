Circuit simulation using successive relaxation method

This MATLAB code utilizes the Successive Relaxation Method to solve an electrical circuit specified by user-input parameters, including resistances, capacitances, inductances, voltage sources, frequency, and a relaxation parameter. It constructs the impedance matrix and voltage vector to represent circuit relationships, checks for convergence, and iteratively solves for mesh currents. The code compares approximated and exact solutions, calculates relative errors and significant digits, and displays magnitudes and phases for each mesh current. Overall, it provides a comprehensive analysis of the circuit's behavior and facilitates the understanding of its electrical characteristics.
